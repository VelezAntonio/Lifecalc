This project is a website that will be used to calculate the users lifestyle wants. Allowing for proper bugeting
using the 50/30/20 rule and showing the user How much they need to make monthly to afford their wants.

Things such as:
1. Budgeting
2. Mortage Payments
3. Car Payments

As of now the website allows the user to register/login. (This connects to a mysql database)
there are checks in place to ensure user cannot register the same email multiple times.
passwords are hashed.
The user can calculate a 30 yr. mortage. and I use an api i made to display todays lowest mortage rate.
